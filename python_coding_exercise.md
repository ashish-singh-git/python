1. Given two integer numbers return their product. If the product is greater than 1000, then return their sum

For example:
							a = 10, b=20, output=200
							a = 100, b=30, output=130



2. Given a list of numbers, Iterate from the start number to the end number, and In each iteration print the sum of the current number and previous number

For example: 

							a = [1,2,3,4]

							output:

`                			`1

`                			`3

`                			`5

`                			`7


1. Given a string, display only those characters which are present at an even index number.

For example:

`			 `s = "pynative" so you should display ‘p’, ‘n’, ‘t’, ‘v’



1. Given a string and an integer number n, remove characters from a string starting from zero up to n and return a new string

For example:

`			`s = "pynative"

`			`n = 4

`			`so output must be "tive"


1. Given a list of numbers, return True if first and last number of a list is same

For example:

`			`Given list is  [10, 20, 30, 40, 10]

`			`result is True

`			`Given list is  [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

`			`result is False


1. Given a list of numbers, Iterate it and print only those numbers which are divisible of 5

For example:

`			`Given list is  [10, 20, 33, 46, 55]

`			`Divisible of 5 in a list

`			`10

`			`20

`			`55


1. Given a two list of numbers create a new list such that new list should contain only odd numbers from the first list and even numbers from the second list

For example:

`			`list1 =  [10, 20, 23, 11, 17]

`			`list2 =  [13, 43, 24, 36, 12]

`			`result List is [23, 11, 17, 24, 36, 12]
